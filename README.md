# R2D2 (More than an Astronomy Bot) 👨‍🚀️

R2D2 is the ultimate companion for space enthusiasts and young astronomers. With a plethora of features, including real-time chat functionality, up-to-date news on the latest space discoveries, notifications on upcoming rocket launches, and the ability to send birthday wishes, this bot is the perfect addition to any space-loving Discord community.



## Deployment 🛰️
This Bot has been deployed in my discord server using Replit( cloud-based development platform ) . And it is been kept alive using uptimeRobot (A Free website monitoring service). 

Discord server link : https://discord.gg/tRgmVU2bga 




Note : Current version of replit does not allow users to use FFMPEG (a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams) due to spamming and other unethical activties. Soon this bot will be hosted by someother free webhosting service. Rest Assured till then ... cheers 🍻️

## Screenshots 🚀️


**I'll leave the rest of the features for you to discover ... Do not forget to check your DM as soon as you enter the server...!**
