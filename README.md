# R2D2 (More than an Astronomy Bot)

R2D2 is the ultimate companion for space enthusiasts and young astronomers.

## Deployment 

This Bot has been deployed in my discord server using Replit( cloud-based development platform ) . And it is been kept alive using uptimeRobot (A Free website monitoring service). 

Discord server link : https://discord.gg/tRgmVU2bga 




Note : Current version of replit does not allow users to use FFMPEG (a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams) due to spamming and other unethical activties. Soon this bot will be hosted by someother free webhosting service. Rest Assured till then ... cheers üçªÔ∏è
